\subsection{GPU-Accelerated OpenCV}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

OpenCV started... 1999 Intel. Today, it is a fully open source library with a vast number of advanced computer vision algorithms. The pre-build library can quickly be plugged into  an IDE such as QTCreator or Visual Studio 2013 (not tested for compatibility with Visual Studio 2015 at the time of writing), thus giving the programmer access to all basic OpenCV features. A steb-by-step guide for using both the pre-built and a custom-built library can be found in Appendix \ref{}.
